Stef, this is what I have:

require fuzzy_realty then issue a query like so:
query = FuzzyRealty::Query.new
query << FuzzyRealty::Parameter(:"symbol type", value)
...
FuzzyRealty::ExpertSystem.scores(listings_array,query)

you will receive an array of hashes arranged like so:
[ {:listing => #<...>, :score => ###}, ...]


Parameters
==========
Parameters are init'd with a symbol type and value
| Type      | Value                                                          |
| :sqft     | Numeric                                                        |
| :style    | One of %W{Bungalow Bi-level Split-level Two-story Condominium} |
| :location | One of %W{A B C D}                                             |
| :price    | Numeric                                                        |
* Values for style and location are very sensitive atm, anything not in the two will likely not work or even error out (i've tried to avoid the erroring out)
