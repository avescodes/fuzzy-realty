Stef, this is what I have:

require fuzzy_realty then issue a query like so:
query = FuzzyRealty::Query.new
query << FuzzyRealty::Parameter(:"symbol type", value)
...
FuzzyRealty::ExpertSystem.scores(listings_array,query)

you will receive an array of hashes arranged like so:
[ {:listing => #<...>, :score => ###}, ...]


Parameters
==========
Parameters are init'd with a symbol type and value
| Type      | Valid Values                                                   |
| :sqft     | Any Numeric                                                    |
| :style    | One of %W{Bungalow Bi-level Split-level Two-story Condominium} |
| :location | One of %W{A B C D}                                             |
| :price    | Any Numeric                                                    |
* Values for style and location are very sensitive atm, anything not in the two will likely not work or even error out (i've tried to avoid the erroring out)

Listings
========
What i expect out of a listing is that it has the following properties that can be read from it:
*price
*sqft
*location
*style
